2025py_s24885 - DNA Sequence Generator

Description

This project is a Python script that generates random DNA sequences in FASTA format. It is designed to help users quickly create, modify, and analyze DNA sequences for educational or research purposes.

Features
	•	Generate a DNA sequence of a specified length.
	•	Insert a user-provided name at a random position within the sequence.
	•	Save the generated sequence in a FASTA format file (.fasta).
	•	Calculate and display the percentage of each nucleotide (A, C, G, T).
	•	Calculate the CG/AT ratio of the sequence.

How to Use
	1.	Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6+).
	2.	Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/MirH-1/2025py_s24885.git
cd 2025py_s24885


	3.	Run the Python script:

python s24885_2025.py


	4.	Follow the on-screen instructions to generate a DNA sequence.

Requirements
	•	Python 3.6 or higher
	•	A basic understanding of DNA sequences (A, C, G, T).
