# 2025py_s24885 - DNA Sequence Generator

This project is a Python script that generates random DNA sequences in FASTA format. It allows users to:
- Generate a DNA sequence of a specified length.
- Insert a user-provided name at a random position in the sequence.
- Save the sequence in a FASTA format file (.fasta).
- Calculate and display the percentage of each nucleotide (A, C, G, T).
- Calculate the CG/AT ratio of the sequence.
